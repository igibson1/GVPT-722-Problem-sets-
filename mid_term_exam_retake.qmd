## Question 1

Imagine you hypothesize that the probability of supporting a law to lower the voting age to 16 is lower for people age 30 and older. Using the table of survey results below answer questions 1a, 1b, and 1c. Please show all of your work.

| Age          | Oppose | Support | TOTAL |
|--------------|--------|---------|-------|
| 18-29        | 100    | 200     | 300   |
| 30 and older | 400    | 300     | 700   |
| TOTAL        | 500    | 500     | 1000  |

: **Probability of Supporting a Law to Lower the Voting Age to 16 by Age (cell counts)**

### Part A

What is the probability of supporting the law? (1 point)

::: callout-note
1/1
:::

ANSWER: 500/1000 = .5 or 50%

### Part B

What is the probability of being 18-29 **or** supporting the law? Write the general (i.e. using symbols) formula you used to obtain your answer and show all of your work. (2 points)

::: callout-note
2/2
:::

P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)

ANSWER: (500/1000 + 300/1000) - (200/1000) = .6 or 60%

### Part C

In terms of the substantive results (ignore statistical significance), does the evidence support your hypothesis? Explain, using details, how you know (no more than 2 sentences). (5 points)

::: callout-note
5/5
:::

P(18-29 and support) = 200/300 = .667

P(30+ and support) = 300/700 = .429

ANSWER: Yes, the evidence does support the hypothesis that the probability of supporting a law to lower the voting age to 16 is lower for people age 30 and older. Ages 18-29 is 66.7% and ages 30+ is 42.9%

## Question 2

A recent poll of 500 likely Republican voters includes 300 "highly educated" respondents and 200 "poorly educated" respondents. Both groups supported Donald Trump at the same rate. If you were to construct confidence intervals around these estimates, would the confidence interval be larger around the highly educated or poorly educated? Why? Answer in [no more than one sentence]{.underline}. (2 points)

::: callout-note
2/2
:::

300 highly educated

200 poorly educated

ANSWER: The CI would be larger around **poorly educated** respondents because a smaller sample size leads to a larger CI.

## Question 3

Provide a political science example of a continuous variable. (1 point)

::: callout-note

ANSWER: Campaign Donations (\$)

## Question 4

Use the information that follows to respond to the questions that come after Table 2.

The OLS regression results in Table 2 were obtained from a survey of 1,500 citizens age 16 to 90 in European Union member nations.Â  The p values are from 2 tailed tests of significance.

**Dependent variable**:

-   European Parliament Feeling Thermometer ranging from 0 (coldest) to 100 (warmest).

**Independent variables**:

-   Female: coded as equal to 1 for females and equal to 0 otherwise.

-   Education: coded in years of education completed and ranges from 0 to 23.

| Independent variables | Coefficient | p-value |
|-----------------------|-------------|---------|
| Constant              | 35          | 0.000   |
| Female                | -7          | 0.000   |
| Education             | 3           | 0.120   |

: **Regression results**

### Part A

In the context described above, is it useful to interpret the coefficient on the constant term on its own? **If it is not useful** to do so explain why it is not. **If it is useful** to do so explain what it reveals. Answer in [no more than 2 sentences]{.underline}. (3 points)

::: callout-note
3/3
:::

ANSWER: **No**, the constant term is not useful to interpret on its own, it provides a **predictive average** on the European Feeling Thermometer rating when an individual is **not** female (female = 0) and when the individual has 0 years of education (education = 0). While Education and Female can be coded/equal 0, it is not particularly useful to look at non-females who have no education at all because it doesn't provide practical insight, most people 16-90 years old have some level of education.

### Part B

Is the result for education statistically significant at the 5% error level? Answer **YES** or **NO** (1 point)

::: callout-note
1/1
:::

p-value = 0.120

ANSWER: NO

### Part C

Will a 95% confidence interval around the coefficient for education include 0? Answer **YES** or **NO** (1 point)

::: callout-note
1/1
:::

ANSWER: YES

### Part D

What is the **substantive meaning** of the coefficient on the education variable (i.e. interpret the coefficient estimate)? Answer in [one sentence]{.underline}. (3 points)

ANSWER: The coefficient variable education shows us that **on average,** a one unit increase education is **associated with a 3 point increase** in the European Feeling Thermometer, **holding all else constant.**

### Part E

Based on the results in Table 2, might the negative coefficient on Female be the result of females having less **income**? In no more than 1 sentence, explain your answer. (3 points)

::: callout-note
3/3
:::

ANSWER: Yes it could be possible that the negative coefficient on Female might be the result of females having less income since income was not included in our model, it is not controlled for.

## Extra credit

A recent study by Dr. Doofenshmirtz found that those who were randomly selected to be exposed to arguments that 16- and 17-year-olds are informed and engaged in local politics increased support for lowering the voting age to 16 by 8 percentage points, from a baseline of support of 45 percentage points in the control condition. On a quantitative methods exam Zuri, Jesse, and Teddy were asked if the effect was substantively significant. The question they were asked did not give any information about statistical significance. The answers they provided follow.

-   Jesse: The effect is not substantively significant because 8 is a small number.

-   Teddy: We just don't know because there isn't any information about statistical significance.

-   Zuri: The effect is substantively significant because this information boosts support over 50%, so a campaign by young people stressing these points could help the policy pass by getting more than 50% support.

Which of the following provides the [**best**]{.underline} evaluation of the above answers?
