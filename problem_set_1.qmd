## Question 1

Imagine you hypothesize that the probability of voting for the incumbent in a two-candidate race is higher for those who are 30 to 65 years old than for those older than 65.

Using the table of survey results below answer questions 1a, 1b, 1c, and 1d. Please show all of your work.

| Age           | Challenger | Incumbent | TOTAL |
|---------------|------------|-----------|-------|
| 18 to 29      | 210        | 250       | 460   |
| 30 to 65      | 245        | 150       | 395   |
| Older than 65 | 160        | 150       | 310   |
| **TOTAL**     | 615        | 550       | 1165  |

: Voting for the Incumbent and Challenger by Age (cell counts)

### Part A

What is the probability of voting for the incumbent? (1 point)

550/1165 = .472

### Part B

What is the probability of being 18-29 or voting for the incumbent? Write the general (i.e. using symbols) formula you used to obtain your answer and show all of your work. (2 points)

### Part C

In terms of the substantive results (ignore statistical significance), does the evidence support your hypothesis? Explain, using details, how you know (no more than 2 sentences). (5 points)

### Part D

Imagine that the values in the **Total** column for each age group in *Table 1* remained the same, but the percentage voting for the incumbent in each age group was 51% (i.e. 51% of each age group voted for the incumbent). Now imagine that you were going to construct 90% confidence intervals, using the z table, for the percentage voting for the incumbent for each age group (don't actually do this). List the age groups in order starting with the one that would have the widest confidence interval to the one that would have the narrowest confidence interval, noting any ties. (3 points)

## Question 2

Provide a political science example of a nominal variable. (1 point)

## Question 3

What is the OLS estimate of $Y = \beta_0 + \epsilon$? (That is, in terms of $Y$, what does the OLS estimate of $\beta_0$ equal?) (2 points)

## Question 4

Answer the questions below based on the following information and table.

$N = 1,200$ from a random sample of 18 and older Canadians.

**Dependent variable:** Feeling Thermometer Rating of George W. Bush (0 to 100: 0 = very cold, 100 = very warm)

**Independent variables:** age (in years), education (in years), have access to U.S. TV stations (1 = yes, 0 = no), ideology (7 point scale: 1 = very liberal, 7 = very conservative)

| Independent variables | Coefficient | SE  | p-value |
|-----------------------|-------------|-----|---------|
| Constant              | 50          | 20  | 0.0126  |
| Age                   | 0.5         | 1   | 0.6172  |
| Education             | -2          | 0.2 | 0.0000  |
| U.S. TV Access        | -5          | 2   | 0.0126  |
| Ideology              | 6           | 3.2 | 0.0610  |

: Hypothetical Regression Results Predicting George W. Bush Thermometer Ratings

### Part A

Calculate the t-statistic for `Education`. (1 point)

### Part B

Interpret the results for the `Education` variable, i.e. BRIEFLY discuss the substantive meaning of the results (1 sentence), substantive significance (no more than 2 sentences), and statistical significance (1 sentence). (5 points)

### Part C

In this context, is the coefficient on the constant term useful on its own? Why or why not (1 sentence) (5 points)

### Part D

Is the coefficient on `U.S. TV access` statistically significant at the 5% error level? (1 point)

### Part E

Is the coefficient on `U.S. TV access` statistically significant at the 1% error level? (1 point)

### Part F

Based on the results in *Table 2*, might the negative coefficient on `U.S. TV Access` be the result of more educated people being more likely to have access to U.S. TV? In no more than 1 sentence, explain your answer. (3 points)
